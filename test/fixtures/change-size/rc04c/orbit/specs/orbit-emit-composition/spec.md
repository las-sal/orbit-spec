# orbit-emit-composition Specification

## Purpose

The engine-owned emit surface (`orbit emit <command>`, D-arc Stage D5): every run-summary JSON on every orbit trail is COMPOSED and WRITTEN by the engine from a narrative-only payload — the emitting AI supplies only the fields it genuinely authors, and the engine owns the universal spine, the deterministic facts, the per-command computed extensions, the filename/collision handling, and a fail-loud write gate that validates the frozen record before a single byte lands. Target resolution covers every trail (change, staging exploration, archived change, architecture doc, bare project scope) with contained-identifier and canonical-trail-child guarantees — the surface writes orbit trails ONLY. This capability retires the hand-composed-emit practice: a wrong-but-plausible record can no longer be authored, only computed.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Generic emit surface with a narrative-only payload contract

The system SHALL expose `orbit emit <command> --change <name>` — ONE generic surface for
composing and writing run-summary emits (naming precedent: the verb-first `orbit fingerprint`).
The payload arrives as JSON on stdin or via `--payload <file>` — when `--payload` is present
stdin is not consulted (no both-channels ambiguity exists), and an absent payload (no flag,
empty or terminal stdin) is a clean non-zero error naming both channels with no file
written — and carries ONLY the
narrative/authored fields for that command per an AUTHORITATIVE engine-owned per-command
payload-field table (the fields the emitting AI genuinely authors — review: `mode`,
`reviewer_class`, `depth`, `flags`, `scorecard`, `findings`, `stale_suppressed`, `commentary`,
`passes_run`, `passes_skipped`; address-reviews: the `source*` fields, `walk_mode`,
`resolutions`, the narrative `final_assessment` — its `iteration` is ENGINE-computed, the
count of prior address-reviews emits on the resolved trail plus one, ANCHORED PER DOC on the
shared architecture trail (a doc-scoped walk counts only logs whose `doc` matches — the same
per-doc rule as the review-architecture ordinal; doc B's walk never counts doc A's logs),
rejected when payload-supplied; propose and ff additionally accept an OPTIONAL structured
`pr_attachment` object (`{branch, granularity, url?, state?, doc?}` — the composite ATTACHMENT
record whose owning definition and key semantics live in `orbit-run-summary-emit`), and
archive additionally accepts OPTIONAL `pr_url` and `pr_state` narrative pass-through fields
(archive RESOLVES no attachment — it reads the one propose/ff recorded and reports the PR
state it observed) (per `orbit-pr-lifecycle` — the trail records
the outward PR artifact's URL and state AS OBSERVED AT EMIT TIME, never a forward-looking
claim: `pr_state` is exactly one of the two lowercase strings `"draft"` or `"ready"` (a
closed or merged PR is NOT representable — the field records the draft/ready axis only, so a
body elides the field both when it CANNOT observe the state and when it observes a condition
off that axis; `pr_url` may still accompany an elided `pr_state`, recording which PR was
observed). The archive emit is written after the
tail's READ-ONLY PREFLIGHT and before its mutations, so it records what the preflight
OBSERVED — normally `"draft"`, and truthfully `"ready"` when the PR was already flipped (by
the USER at an earlier point, including at a prior program's arc-done for a program PR
adopted afterward — never by a stage);
the READY transition that the tail performs afterward is evidenced by the PR itself and the
completion readout, NOT by a field asserting a state that has not happened. Both fields are
elided when absent, never computed by the engine); the table's per-command rows derive from the
owning capability's emit definitions, and these inline lists are EXCERPTS of that derivation —
the owning capability's definition governs when they diverge). Fields the engine owns (`command`, `timestamp`,
`change`, `kind`, the filename token, every deterministic fact per the deterministic-facts
requirement, and every computed extension) SHALL be REJECTED when present in the payload with
a clean error naming the field — a second voice on a computable fact is refused at the seam,
never silently overwritten. Keys in NEITHER the command's payload table nor the engine-owned
set SHALL likewise be REJECTED naming the key — a typo'd narrative key (`pases_run`) fails
loudly at the seam, never passes silently into the record. The per-skill
`references/run-summary-schema.md` payload lists MIRROR the engine table, never define it. An
unknown `<command>` fails with a clean error naming the emittable command set. The payload SHALL include a `model` key (nullable — the emitting AI's model
identity, or explicit `null` when unknown); a payload missing the key is rejected naming it,
so provenance is always a conscious act.

#### Scenario: Payload carries only authored fields

- **WHEN** `orbit emit review --change foo` receives a payload with `mode`, `reviewer_class`, `depth`, `scorecard`, `findings: []`, and `model`
- **THEN** the engine composes the full emit around those fields and writes it to `orbit/changes/foo/.orbit-runs/review-<mode>-<TS>.json`

#### Scenario: Engine-owned field in the payload is rejected

- **WHEN** a payload includes `timestamp` or `next_recommended`
- **THEN** the surface exits non-zero with a clean error naming the engine-owned field; no file is written

#### Scenario: Unknown payload key is rejected

- **WHEN** a review payload includes `pases_run` — a key in neither the review payload table nor the engine-owned set
- **THEN** the surface exits non-zero with a clean error naming the unknown key; no file is written

#### Scenario: Missing model key is rejected

- **WHEN** a payload omits the `model` key entirely
- **THEN** the surface exits non-zero naming `model` (explicit `null` is accepted); no file is written

#### Scenario: Unknown command

- **WHEN** `orbit emit frobnicate --change foo` is invoked
- **THEN** the surface exits non-zero with a clean error naming the supported command set; no file is written

#### Scenario: PR pass-through fields record emit-time truth

- **WHEN** an archive payload includes `pr_url` and `pr_state` carrying the value the read-only preflight observed — `"draft"` ordinarily, or `"ready"` for a PR already flipped before this archive
- **THEN** the written emit carries both fields verbatim; the engine enforces the enum and the observed-not-predicted contract, not a particular value (a body composing a state it did NOT observe is the false record — including asserting `"ready"` on the strength of a flip the tail has yet to perform); the same fields on a review payload are rejected as unknown keys

### Requirement: Engine-owned spine composition and filename discipline

The surface SHALL compose the universal spine (per `orbit-conventions`): `command` from the
argument, `timestamp` as the current UTC instant in standard colon format, `change` from
`--change` (or `null` with a `doc` extension for architecture-scoped commands), `kind` from an
engine-internal command→kind taxonomy table (workflow / editorial / lifecycle — the taxonomy in
`orbit-conventions` becomes engine data, not prose bodies re-state), and the emit path from the
command's persistence location (change trail, explore trail, or architecture trail). The
target-resolution contract: `--change <name>` names the WORKSTREAM — a change, or the staging
exploration for explore-trail emits — resolved per the command's trail. Scope capability is
PER COMMAND: `architect` is architecture-ONLY, taking `--doc <doc-name>` (supplying `--change`
to it is a clean usage error); `review` is DUAL-SCOPE on the
change/architecture axis, resolved PER INVOCATION — `--change` routes it to the change
trail, `--doc` to the architecture trail (serving `orbit-review`'s architecture mode);
`address-reviews` is TRIPLE-SCOPE — `--change` (with an ARCHIVED-change fallback: an
active/staging miss resolves against `orbit/changes/archive/*-<name>/` by the archive emit's
lexically-greatest rule, landing the log on the archived trail), `--doc` (the
architecture-scoped resolution logs: `change: null` + `doc`), and BARE for the anchor-less
whole-repo walk, resolving `orbit/.orbit-runs/` (created if absent) with `change: null`, where
the payload's `remaining_markers_in_scope` (a REQUIRED non-negative integer at this scope — it
drives the engine's findings-dependent recommendation) fails loud when missing or invalid,
never defaulting to a clean record — every walk persists through the surface, no scope
hand-writes its log;
`audit-drift` is dual-scope on the change/PROJECT axis — with `--change` it is
change-scoped, bare it is project-scoped, resolving `orbit/.orbit-runs/` (created if absent)
with `change: null`, and `--doc` on it is a usage error; every other command is
change-scoped-only (`--doc` to it is a clean usage error). Both flags at once is always a
clean usage error, and a bare invocation of any command without a bare scope (everything
except the two project-scoped commands, `audit-drift` and `address-reviews`) is a
missing-target usage error. A
`--change`/`--doc` value SHALL be a single canonical identifier — a workstream name or doc
filename stem, never a path: separators, traversal segments, and leading dots are a clean
usage error before any resolution (the same contained-identity rule as architecture doc
names); an existing target directory that physically resolves outside its orbit root (a
symlinked container escape) is refused; and the `.orbit-runs` trail child must physically BE its container's canonical `.orbit-runs`
child (IDENTITY, not ancestry: an in-container alias like `.orbit-runs -> .` or a sibling
redirect is refused exactly like an outside escape — a lexically-correct path whose physical
record no trail reader would find is not a trail), checked TWICE — after creation, and again
AFTER every caller-supplied value is materialized into the final bytes, immediately before
the write (no caller-controlled code runs between the final check and the write, closing the
check/use window across composition). The CONTENT is frozen the same way: the record is
materialized to inert plain data BEFORE the write gate runs, the gate validates that frozen
record, and the written bytes are serialized from the same frozen record — the gate-validated
candidate and the written bytes are ONE read of caller state, so no getter or toJSON hook can
present gate-clean values and serialize different ones. The surface writes orbit trails ONLY, and
no failure path writes any file. A
`--change`/`--doc` value that resolves to no on-disk workstream (no change directory, no
staging directory, no architecture doc) fails with a clean error naming the path checked; no
file is written. The
filename `<TS>` token is the timestamp with colons replaced by hyphens; when the target path
already exists, the token is bumped forward one second until free (the collision rule bodies
previously taught as prose — engine-owned here, preserving lexical ordering guarantees).
Filename-token resolution — INCLUDING any collision bump — precedes deterministic-fact
composition: a recommendation that names this emit's own path always names the FINAL written
path, never a pre-bump token.

#### Scenario: Anchor-less walk persists through the bare project scope

- **WHEN** `orbit emit address-reviews --payload <file>` runs bare after a whole-repo marker walk
- **THEN** the log lands at `orbit/.orbit-runs/address-reviews-<TS>.json` with `change: null`, composed and gated by the engine — never hand-written

#### Scenario: Archived-change walk persists to the archived trail

- **WHEN** `orbit emit address-reviews --change <name>` runs and `<name>` exists only under `orbit/changes/archive/`
- **THEN** the resolution falls back to the lexically-greatest `archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/` match and the log lands on that archived trail

#### Scenario: Traversal-shaped targets never write

- **WHEN** `orbit emit explore --change ../elsewhere` (or any target value carrying separators, `..`, or a leading dot) runs
- **THEN** the invocation fails with the clean canonical-identifier usage error before resolution; no directory is created and no file is written anywhere

#### Scenario: Collision bumps forward

- **WHEN** an emit composes to a filename that already exists in the trail
- **THEN** the `<TS>` token advances one second at a time until the path is free, and the JSON `timestamp` field matches the final token

#### Scenario: Trail location per command

- **WHEN** `orbit emit explore --change foo` runs for a staging exploration
- **THEN** the file lands in `orbit/explore/foo/.orbit-runs/` (the explore trail); change-scoped commands land in `orbit/changes/<name>/.orbit-runs/`; architecture-scoped commands land in `orbit/architecture/.orbit-runs/`; bare project-scoped `orbit emit audit-drift` lands in `orbit/.orbit-runs/`; `orbit emit archive` lands in the ARCHIVED change's trail `orbit/changes/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/.orbit-runs/` (per the atomic-recommendation requirement's archive rule)

#### Scenario: Project-scope emit takes no target flag

- **WHEN** `orbit emit audit-drift` runs with neither `--change` nor `--doc`
- **THEN** the file lands at `orbit/.orbit-runs/audit-drift-<TS>.json` with `change: null`; the same invocation with `--change foo` is change-scoped to foo's trail, and supplying `--doc` is a clean usage error

### Requirement: Deterministic facts are engine-composed per command

Where a capability defines an emit field as a deterministic fact, the surface SHALL compute it
— never accept it from the payload: for review emits, `final_assessment` is the severity-counts
sentence derived from the payload's scorecard (`"X critical, Y warning, Z suggestion."` /
`"No findings."`) and `next_recommended` is the findings-dependent pointer — the
address-reviews `--from-file` invocation naming this emit's own path when findings exist (all
modes; the architecture-scoped walk ingests exactly like the change-scoped one); when CLEAN,
the `orbit status --change <name> --report` render pointer for proposal/system, and for
architecture mode — where `change` is null and no report surface exists — the payload's
architect-owned `handoff.next_command`, MIRRORED per the architect rule below — per
`orbit-report-rendering`'s strict contract, which the write gate enforces on proposal/system —
and review emits'
`iteration` is likewise engine-computed: for proposal/system the next ordinal on the SHARED
internal+external pass axis (the report ordinal's counting rule per `orbit-report-rendering`);
for architecture mode the per-DOC ordinal (prior `review-architecture-*.json` emits with
matching `doc` + 1 — the `orbit-review` baseline's own per-doc anchoring), never
payload-supplied — the ordinal-divergence seam D4 closed at render time stays closed at write
time; for review-external
T0 emits, `next_recommended` is the multi-step paste/save/ingest recommendation composed from
the prompt path template and `awaiting_findings: true` is engine-set; for explore emits, the
counts and maturity-grid recommendation per the computed-extensions requirement; for apply
emits, `final_assessment`'s CORE is the engine-composed chunk/counts sentence from the fields
the engine already computes (`"Completed chunk 2 of 5 (inventory+parsing); 28 of 76 tasks
done."`, with paused and no-chunking variants from `chunk_complete`/`chunk`), and the payload
MAY supply an optional `assessment_suffix` string (the judgment sentence) that the engine
appends after the core — a payload-supplied `final_assessment` on an apply emit is rejected
as engine-owned (the two-voices seam the D-d5-1 governing rule closes; review's counts
sentence is the precedent); for architect emits, the spine's `next_recommended` is
engine-COPIED verbatim from the payload's architect-owned `handoff.next_command` (the
`handoff` section remains the single authored home — the spine field mirrors it, never a
second author; direct payload supply of spine `next_recommended` stays rejected). The
remaining emitting commands (the propose family, verify, audit-drift) derive their
recommendations as deterministic facts from their owning capability's recommendation
requirements in `orbit-run-summary-emit` — no emitting command lacks a composition rule.

#### Scenario: Review counts sentence composed from the payload scorecard

- **WHEN** a review payload's scorecard sums to 1 warning
- **THEN** the written emit's `final_assessment` is `0 critical, 1 warning, 0 suggestion.` and `next_recommended` names this emit's own path in an address-reviews invocation

#### Scenario: Review iteration engine-computed from the shared pass axis

- **WHEN** `orbit emit review --change foo` runs with two prior passes on foo's shared internal+external axis
- **THEN** the emit carries `iteration: 3` computed from the trail; a payload supplying `iteration` is rejected naming the field

#### Scenario: T0 recommendation composed from the path template

- **WHEN** `orbit emit review-external --change foo` receives a payload with `prompt_path`
- **THEN** the emit's `next_recommended` is the paste/save/ingest prose naming the prompt path and the expected findings path pattern, and `awaiting_findings` is `true`

#### Scenario: Apply assessment core engine-composed, suffix appended

- **WHEN** `orbit emit apply --change foo` fires at chunk-2 completion with payload `assessment_suffix: "Parser edge cases ran deeper than planned."`
- **THEN** the written `final_assessment` is the engine-composed chunk/counts core followed by the suffix; a payload supplying `final_assessment` itself is rejected naming the field

#### Scenario: Architect recommendation mirrors the handoff

- **WHEN** `orbit emit architect --doc my-program` receives a payload whose `handoff.next_command` names the resume invocation
- **THEN** the emit's spine `next_recommended` equals that handoff value verbatim — mirrored, not re-authored; a payload supplying spine `next_recommended` directly is still rejected naming the field

### Requirement: Atomic next_recommended — pre-computable and post-write classes

`next_recommended` SHALL be composed in one of two engine-owned ways, resolved per command:
(a) PRE-COMPUTABLE — commands whose recommendation derives from the payload or an
already-parsed on-disk source, with no dependence on the emit having landed (review's
findings-dependent pointer from the payload's scorecard, T0's path template, explore's
maturity grid from the parsed staging `explore.md`, archive's stock post-archive prose — an
engine-owned constant, the ARCHITECTURE-SCOPED emits — review `--as architecture`'s
handoff mirror and the doc-scoped address-reviews walk, whose recommendation is the gate-less
confirm pointer naming the doc (`/orbit:review --as architecture <doc>` to confirm the
resolutions) since no change status exists to synthesize): composed before the write;
(b) POST-WRITE SEMANTICS — CHANGE-SCOPED invocations of commands whose
recommendation is the engine's canonical `next_command` AFTER this emit joins the trail
(address-reviews, apply; the class keeps the POST-WRITE name for its SEMANTICS — the
recommendation reflects the landed state — though no provisional file is ever written): the
engine composes the candidate complete except `next_recommended`, computes the change status
against a SYNTHETIC TRAIL — the on-disk trail plus the in-memory candidate treated as already
landed — stamps the field, passes the now-complete record through the full write gate, and
writes EXACTLY ONCE, atomically (temp-file + rename or equivalent). No provisional RECORD
ever exists on the trail: the write gate's before-any-write claim holds for every kind with
ZERO exceptions — the temp file's name never parses as an emit, so no trail reader can see a
half-written record; any failure the process survives cleans the temp file up (a hard kill MAY
strand an inert temp file — noise the trail never reads, never a record) — and the
written emit's `next_recommended` equals the engine's post-landing `next_command` BY
CONSTRUCTION — extended, for apply chunk emits only, by the engine-composed
` — next chunk: <chunk-name>` suffix from the preamble (still one voice: every character is
engine-owned). The emitting AI never performs the write-then-check-then-correct dance.
(`orbit-orientation`'s spine-invalid surfacing remains as defense-in-depth against corruption
from OTHER sources — hand-tampering, partial copies, pre-capability tooling; nothing on this
path can produce a half-written record.) `orbit emit archive` writes to the ARCHIVED change's
trail (`orbit/changes/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/.orbit-runs/`) AFTER the directory move
completes — the archive directory is resolved by scanning `orbit/changes/archive/` for
`*-<name>/` matches and taking the lexically greatest (never composed from today's date,
which diverges from the move's date across a UTC midnight); no match fails with the
target-resolution contract's clean not-found error. The emit records an outcome
(`archive_path`, the archived-to sentence), and
composing it before the move would record an outcome that does not yet exist; no status
recompute runs against an archived change.

#### Scenario: Post-write stamping matches the engine

- **WHEN** `orbit emit address-reviews --change foo` completes with all findings resolved
- **THEN** the written emit's `next_recommended` equals `orbit status --change foo --json`'s `next_command` computed AFTER the emit landed — byte-identical, by construction

#### Scenario: Every class writes once, complete

- **WHEN** `orbit emit review --change foo` (pre-computable) or `orbit emit apply --change foo` (post-write semantics) runs
- **THEN** the file is written exactly once, complete — no transient missing-field state exists for ANY class

#### Scenario: Crash during synthetic-trail composition leaves no file

- **WHEN** the surface crashes after computing the synthetic-trail status but before the atomic write completes
- **THEN** the trail is unchanged — no file, no partial record; the invocation simply failed

#### Scenario: Archive emit is pre-computable and lands on the archived trail

- **WHEN** `orbit emit archive --change foo` runs after the archive flow has moved the change to `orbit/changes/archive/2026-08-03-foo/`
- **THEN** the emit writes once, complete, to `orbit/changes/archive/2026-08-03-foo/.orbit-runs/archive-<TS>.json` with the engine-composed stock post-archive `next_recommended`; no status recompute runs against the archived change

### Requirement: Write-gate validation via the shared normalizers

Before ANY write, the composed candidate SHALL pass the same validation the read side uses.
For review emits the gate is MODE-SCOPED (D4's architecture-mode render exemption drawn at
write time): proposal/system review emits pass `orbit-report-rendering`'s strict internal
normalizer (spine semantics, scorecard/findings cell-rollup equality, single-line slot
enforcement, dimension membership); architecture-mode review emits — which that normalizer
rejects by design (`mode` pinned to `proposal|system`, spine `change` required to be a
string) — instead pass the universal-spine checks (which SHALL accept `change: null` plus a
required `doc` for architecture-scoped emits), the same scorecard/findings cell-rollup
equality, and the `orbit-architect`-owned `handoff`-section shape. Every kind passes the
universal-spine checks. Validation failure means NO file, a non-zero exit, the field-naming
error on stderr, and empty stdout. One validator, two gates: the fail-loud boundary that D4
placed at render time moves to write time, so a malformed emit is refused before it becomes a
record rather than discovered when rendered.

**THE ORDERING REFUSAL (rc04a).** A payload carrying JUDGEMENT RECORDS — identified by the presence
of the top-level `judgements` KEY, and by nothing else — SHALL additionally pass an ORDERING check
PER ENTRY. `judgements` is an ARRAY (shape owned by `orbit-run-summary-emit`) and each entry carries
its own `formed_against`, so the check iterates: it is not one comparison against a merged set, and
two entries on one emit may legitimately cite different passes. For EVERY entry,
every token in that entry's `formed_against` MUST be STRICTLY EARLIER than the EMIT'S OWN `<TS>` FILENAME
TOKEN — the engine-composed one, compared in that single representation. The record carries no
timestamp of its own; the comparand is the emit's, and naming it explicitly matters because the
emit holds that instant in TWO forms (the colon-bearing JSON `timestamp` and the hyphenated
filename `<TS>`) and comparing across the two would silently never match. An ENTRY citing a token equal to or later than that
is REFUSED, naming the offending token, the emit's token, and the entry's index — an array of
judgements needs the index or the error cannot be acted on. This is the single computed thing about a judgement
record and the reason the record is buildable at all: R-crc-11(g) requires the AI to judge
readiness KNOWING what the independent reviewers returned, belief is not observable, and ORDERING
is. The engine SHALL NOT evaluate whether the judgement was correct, whether the cited passes were
clean, or whether enough of them were cited — it refuses only a claim that COULD NOT have been
informed by the evidence it names.

The check is SCOPED BY PRESENCE so that no emit that exists today can newly fail: a payload with no
`judgements` key carries no judgement record and is not ordering-checked. Scoping on the KEY rather
than on a nested field is what keeps the check cheap and total — the engine decides whether to
descend at all before it reads anything inside. The RESOLUTION SOURCE is the trail reader's PASS SET — the same `trail.passes` that clause (a)
coverage reads, which admits `review-(proposal|system)-<TS>.json` AND `external-(proposal|system)-<TS>.md`.
Naming it matters: an external pass has no JSON emit and `review-external-<TS>.json` is a PACKAGING
record rather than a pass, so without this the most common external citation would look
unresolvable. A token naming nothing in that set is REFUSED as unresolvable rather than silently
skipped — a citation that cannot be resolved certifies nothing, which is the `Q-crc-17` failure
mode in a new field.

Two edges are settled rather than left to the implementer. (a) An `in-context` token is REFUSED:
`formed_against` names INDEPENDENT passes, and an in-context pass is not one — this is a
well-formedness check on the citation, not the forbidden judgement about whether ENOUGH passes were
cited. (b) A REJECTED external return (`trail.rejectedExternals` — a return that came back
unreadable and still cost a run) is not a pass and citing one is REFUSED: it satisfies no slot and
carries no findings a judgement could have been formed against. (c) The cited pass's MODE is
DELIBERATELY NOT CHECKED, and this is settled rather than overlooked: `TrailPass.mode` is as
observable as the other two, so a terminal `readiness` at archive citing only a
`review-proposal` pass could be refused as a category confusion. It is not, because a proposal-phase
pass genuinely CAN inform a terminal judgement — a design objection raised before apply and accepted
without resolution is exactly an `accepted` pair — and refusing it would be the engine ruling on
whether the cited evidence was the RIGHT evidence, which is the judgement R-crc-10 puts off limits.
Edges (a) and (b) are well-formedness of the CITATION; mode would be an opinion about the
JUDGEMENT.

#### Scenario: Scorecard/findings mismatch refused at write

- **WHEN** a review payload's scorecard shows zero warnings while its findings contain a WARNING entry
- **THEN** `orbit emit review` exits non-zero naming the mismatched cell; no file is written; stdout is empty

#### Scenario: Forged single-line slot refused at write

- **WHEN** a review payload's finding title contains an embedded newline
- **THEN** the surface exits non-zero naming the slot; no file is written

#### Scenario: Architecture-mode review emit passes the mode-scoped gate

- **WHEN** `orbit emit review --doc my-program` composes an architecture-mode summary (`change: null`, `doc`, `handoff` section) with a valid spine and a rollup-consistent scorecard
- **THEN** the emit writes — the strict internal normalizer (proposal/system-only) is not applied; the universal-spine checks accept `change: null` + `doc`, and a missing or malformed `handoff` section is refused naming the section

#### Scenario: A readiness record citing a LATER pass is refused

- **WHEN** an archive payload's `judgements` array holds a `readiness` entry whose `formed_against`
  names a pass token later than the emit's own `<TS>` token
- **THEN** the surface exits non-zero naming the offending token and the emit's `<TS>` token; no file
  is written; stdout is empty

#### Scenario: A record citing its own timestamp exactly is refused

- **WHEN** an entry's `formed_against` names a token EQUAL to the emit's own `<TS>` token
- **THEN** it is refused — the comparison is STRICTLY earlier, because a judgement formed in the
  same second as the pass it cites cannot be shown to have been informed by it

#### Scenario: An unresolvable citation is refused rather than skipped

- **WHEN** an entry's `formed_against` names a token matching no readable pass on the change's trail
- **THEN** the emit is refused naming the unresolvable token — a citation that resolves to nothing
  certifies nothing

#### Scenario: The check runs per entry, not over a merged set

- **WHEN** an emit's `judgements` array holds two entries, one citing only earlier tokens and one
  citing a later token
- **THEN** the emit is refused naming the SECOND entry's index and its offending token — a valid
  entry does not rescue an invalid one, and a merged comparison would have hidden it

#### Scenario: A payload with no judgement record is not ordering-checked

- **WHEN** any emit without a `judgements` key is composed
- **THEN** the ordering check does not run and the emit's behaviour is byte-identical to before this
  change — the check is scoped by PRESENCE so no existing emit can newly fail

### Requirement: Per-command computed extensions

The surface SHALL compute the per-command extension fields that are functions of on-disk
state: for `explore` emits — `decisions_captured`, `open_questions_count`, and
`open_questions_with_recommendation` ("n of m") parsed fence-aware from the staging
`explore.md`. The counter grammar: each counter counts TOP-LEVEL list items directly under
the `## Decisions` / `## Open questions` heading (nested bullets, paragraphs, and fenced
content are never entries); a heading absent entirely yields count 0 for that section (`"0 of
0"` for the attestation) plus a single stderr note naming the missing section — the
five-section format makes absence a format violation to surface, never an emit blocker. The
attestation's MEMBERSHIP criterion: an entry counts toward `n` when its content carries a
`Standing recommendation:` line whose value is NOT the literal `none yet` — the attestation
measures RECORDED LEANINGS (the leak-hardening intent), so `none yet` entries and slot-less
entries both fall outside `n`; slot-less entries are audit-drift's format finding, never the
counter's concern. Also
computed: the maturity-grid `next_recommended` (Early / Mid / Mature / Stalled per
`orbit-run-summary-emit`'s maturity requirement — the grid is engine data); for `apply` emits —
`tasks_completed`/`tasks_remaining` from checkbox arithmetic, `user_validation_remaining` and
the per-chunk user-validation subset from the payload's `user_validation_tasks` identifier
list (the payload's ONE checkbox judgment — which tasks are user-validation; each named task
is validated to exist and be unchecked, a bad entry rejected naming it; the count itself is
engine-owned and rejected when payload-supplied), `chunk`/`chunk_name`/
`chunk_complete` from the tasks.md chunk-preamble grammar (parsed by the engine —
`chunk_complete` = the current chunk's unchecked tasks minus its user-validation subset, the
whole task set standing in as the "current chunk" when `chunk` is null, per
`orbit-run-summary-emit`'s field semantics; a malformed
preamble degrades per `orbit-run-summary-emit`'s tolerant-on-read rule with the documented
stderr warning), and `files_touched` — the file paths changed since the previous apply
emit's BOUNDARY, engine-computed as `git diff --name-only <base>` against the WORKING TREE:
committed and uncommitted tracked changes both count (the emit is a boundary snapshot, and
sessions routinely reach the boundary before the chunk's commit lands — a committed-only
list would under-report at exactly the moment the field fires; brand-new untracked files
stay invisible until staged, a stated git-visibility limitation). The BOUNDARY is exact,
never timestamp-inferred: at every apply emit the engine captures the tracked working state
as a git TREE OBJECT (`git write-tree` against a temporary index — the `git stash create`
mechanism) and records its OID as the emit's engine-computed `diff_base` field; the next
emit's `<base>` IS the previous emit's recorded `diff_base` tree, so the list is per-chunk
exact under EVERY commit ordering — late-committed prior-chunk work cannot reappear in the
next chunk's list. The FIRST apply emit — and any emit whose predecessor carries no
`diff_base` (pre-capability) or whose recorded tree object is no longer present (gc pruned;
the snapshot is content-addressed and deliberately unreferenced) — falls back to the
change's first commit as its base; `null` only outside a git repository or when no base
resolves at all, never a hand-listed approximation. (The boot render's ACTUAL touchpoints map remains committed-only
`<change-start>..HEAD` per `orbit-orientation` — a durable-truth view computed fresh per
invocation; the two diffs are deliberately different.) Payload attempts to supply any computed
extension are rejected as engine-owned fields.

#### Scenario: Explore counts computed from the file

- **WHEN** `orbit emit explore --change foo` runs against a staging `explore.md` with 4 decisions and 2 open questions — one carrying a real leaning, one reading `Standing recommendation: none yet`
- **THEN** the emit carries `decisions_captured: 4`, `open_questions_count: 2`, `open_questions_with_recommendation: "1 of 2"` (the `none yet` entry falls outside `n`), and the Stalled-state recommendation — none supplied by the payload

#### Scenario: Missing section heading counts zero with a format note

- **WHEN** `orbit emit explore --change foo` runs against a staging `explore.md` that lacks a `## Open questions` heading
- **THEN** the emit still writes, carrying `open_questions_count: 0` and `open_questions_with_recommendation: "0 of 0"`, and a single stderr note names the missing section

#### Scenario: Apply chunk fields computed from tasks.md

- **WHEN** `orbit emit apply --change foo` runs mid-chunk-2 of a 3-chunk tasks.md, with some chunk work committed and some still uncommitted in the working tree
- **THEN** the chunk fields and checkbox totals are engine-parsed; `files_touched` lists the paths changed since the prior apply emit's recorded `diff_base` boundary — committed and uncommitted tracked changes both included — and this emit records its own fresh `diff_base`; `null` when no base resolves

#### Scenario: First apply emit references the change's first commit

- **WHEN** the first apply emit for a change fires (no previous apply emit carrying `diff_base`) inside a git repository
- **THEN** `files_touched` is computed against the change's first commit as the base — not `null` — and the emit records its own `diff_base` tree for the next boundary

#### Scenario: Late-committed chunk work does not reappear

- **WHEN** chunk 1's emit fires with its work uncommitted (the boundary tree recorded as `diff_base`) and that work is committed only afterward
- **THEN** chunk 2's `files_touched`, diffed from chunk 1's recorded `diff_base` tree, excludes chunk 1's files unless the session touched them again — per-chunk exactness holds under every commit ordering

#### Scenario: User-validation judgment supplied as a verified task list

- **WHEN** `orbit emit apply --change foo` receives payload `user_validation_tasks: ["9.6"]` and task 9.6 exists unchecked in the final chunk
- **THEN** the engine computes `user_validation_remaining: 1` and the final chunk's `chunk_complete` from the per-chunk subset; a payload naming a checked or nonexistent task exits non-zero naming the entry, and a payload supplying `user_validation_remaining` directly is rejected as engine-owned

### Requirement: Output contract and read-only guarantee beyond the emit

On success the surface SHALL print the written path to stdout. With `--json`, stdout is
instead EXACTLY ONE structured JSON object — `{path, emit, render?}`: `path` the written
file, `emit` the complete composed emit, `render` present only when `--render` applies —
never a plain-text line preceding or following the object (automation consumers parse one
document, no split heuristics). Without `--json`, for proposal/system review emits `--render`
additionally prints
the engine report render (the `orbit status --change <name> --report` output) after the
path — persist-first and run-and-paste collapse into one invocation. For architecture-mode
review emits `--render` is a no-op with a one-line stderr note (the report render is a
change-scoped surface; no architecture report surface exists — D4's architecture exemption). The surface writes EXACTLY one file (the emit,
atomically, for every class) and modifies nothing else — no artifact,
no metadata, no baseline.

#### Scenario: Render in the same breath

- **WHEN** `orbit emit review --change foo --render` succeeds
- **THEN** stdout carries the written path followed by the engine-rendered report for the just-written pass

#### Scenario: --json is one machine-readable object

- **WHEN** `orbit emit review --change foo --json --render` succeeds
- **THEN** stdout is exactly one JSON object with `path`, `emit`, and `render` keys — no plain-text framing precedes or follows it

#### Scenario: Exactly one file

- **WHEN** any `orbit emit` invocation succeeds
- **THEN** the trail gains exactly one new file and no other file in the project changed

### Requirement: Payload tables agree with their schema references

For every emit command whose per-command schema is documented in a `references/*schema*.md` file (review, address-reviews, audit-drift, archive), a test SHALL derive the AI-supplied field set from that reference — the top-level keys of its schema block minus one explicit, asserted-non-empty list of engine-owned spine and computed fields — and assert that the command's `payloadFields` table accepts every derived field. A field the reference documents as AI-supplied but the table rejects is a failing test, never an archive-time discovery. The engine table remains the definition and the reference remains its mirror; the test makes them agree without changing which is authoritative. Commands whose payload fields are documented only inline in bodies are outside this requirement (recorded for the artifact-lint stage).

#### Scenario: A documented conditional field is accepted by the table

- **WHEN** the archive schema reference documents `gate_overridden`, `fingerprint_overridden`, `fingerprints_unverified`, and `audit_skipped_via_flag`
- **THEN** the parity test asserts each is in the archive command's `payloadFields`, and removing any one from the table fails the test naming the field and the reference

#### Scenario: Every full-record block is read

- **WHEN** a schema reference carries more than one JSON block whose top-level keys include `command` (the review reference documents change modes and architecture mode separately)
- **THEN** the parity test unions the blocks' keys before subtraction, so a field documented only in a later block (architecture mode's) is checked against the table like any other

#### Scenario: A new engine-owned key must be declared

- **WHEN** a schema reference gains a top-level key that is engine-composed rather than AI-supplied
- **THEN** the test fails until the key is added to the explicit engine-owned list — a visible edit, never a silent pass
