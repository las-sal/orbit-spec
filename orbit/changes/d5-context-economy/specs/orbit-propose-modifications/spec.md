## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Section-to-artifact mapping

The system SHALL map `explore.md` sections to the generated artifacts as follows. Additionally
(D-arc Stage D5), the generated `design.md` SHALL carry a `## Touchpoints` section — the
PREDICTED map of where the work lands in the codebase (files/modules to be created or
modified), seeded in consume mode from leanings and references captured in `explore.md` and
authored fresh in standalone mode. The predicted map is revised only through normal artifact
revision (the proposal review cadence bounds its staleness like any design claim) and is
FROZEN once apply begins — from the first apply commit onward it reads as "the plan", while
the ACTUAL map is engine-computed from the diff (per `orbit-orientation`'s boot render and
`orbit-run-summary-emit`'s `files_touched`); prose never tracks what git knows, and
predicted-vs-actual divergence is a computed check (per `orbit-audit-drift`), not a
maintenance chore.

#### Scenario: Premise → proposal motivation

- **WHEN** `explore.md` has a Premise section
- **THEN** the content is used to seed `proposal.md`'s "Why" / motivation section

#### Scenario: Decisions → spec deltas + design + tasks

- **WHEN** `explore.md` has Decisions
- **THEN** the decisions inform spec requirements, design.md decisions, and tasks; specific wording from the Decisions is preserved where artifact format permits

#### Scenario: Considered & out → design alternatives

- **WHEN** `explore.md` has Considered & out entries
- **THEN** they are surfaced in `design.md`'s "Alternatives considered" or equivalent section to prevent rediscovery

#### Scenario: References → contextual reads

- **WHEN** `explore.md` lists References
- **THEN** those files/URLs are read during artifact generation as context (not copied verbatim)

#### Scenario: Touchpoints authored at propose

- **WHEN** artifacts are generated (consume or standalone mode)
- **THEN** `design.md` includes a `## Touchpoints` section with the predicted file/module map — seeded from the exploration's leanings in consume mode — and the section is never hand-updated after apply's first commit (the actual map is the engine's to compute)
