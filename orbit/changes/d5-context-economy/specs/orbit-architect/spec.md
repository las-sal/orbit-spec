## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Architect run-summary emit with handoff section

`/orbit:architect` SHALL emit `orbit/architecture/.orbit-runs/architect-<TS>.json` at
conversation boundaries (the conversation-boundary timing per `orbit-run-summary-emit`'s
`Emit timing semantics`; architect fires no BEGIN emit — the begin+boundary genre is
named-mode explore's, D-arc Stage D3), on the universal spine
(`kind: "workflow"`, `change: null`) with per-command extensions: `doc` (the architecture doc's
name), `stages_touched`, `rulings_captured`, `completions_ratified` (stage ids, possibly empty),
and — per arc ruling R-d-9(b), complied with from birth — a structured `handoff` section:
`boot_sequence` (ordered pointers, never duplicated substance), `next_command`, `model_hint`,
and `seam`. `/orbit:review --as architecture` emits carry the same `handoff` section (its shape
is owned here; the review emit itself is specified in `orbit-review`). The emit is composed via
the engine surface (`orbit emit architect` per `orbit-emit-composition` — D-arc Stage D5), and
the BOUNDARY RESIDENCY SWEEP precedes it (leak-hardening layer 2, shared with named-mode
explore per `orbit-explore-modifications`): rulings, leanings, rejections, and citations
discussed since the last emit must be doc-resident (in the arc doc's rulings, a stage's
charter, or its status log) before the emit fires — "no emit without sweep", riding the
existing boundary trigger with no new prompt.

#### Scenario: Emit lands in the architecture trail with handoff

- **WHEN** an architect session against doc `my-program` reaches a boundary
- **THEN** `orbit/architecture/.orbit-runs/architect-<TS>.json` is written with `doc: "my-program"`, the spine fields, and a `handoff` object whose `boot_sequence` entries are pointers into existing artifacts

#### Scenario: Sweep precedes the architect emit

- **WHEN** an architect session discussed a ruling that has not yet been written into the doc
- **THEN** the body writes it doc-resident BEFORE invoking `orbit emit architect` — the trail never records a boundary whose discussed substance lives only in the conversation
