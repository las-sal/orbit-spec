## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Archive summary schema reference ships with the skill

The generated `orbit-archive-change` skill SHALL include
`references/archive-summary-schema.md` — the full schema for the Step 5.5 archive run-summary
JSON that the skill body already instructs the AI to read when composing the summary. The
content is migrated from the overlay's `openspec-archive-change/references/archive-summary-schema.md`
(orbit-named paths), satisfying the deferral recorded in B1.

#### Scenario: Reference exists after init

- **WHEN** `orbit init` generates the `orbit-archive-change` skill
- **THEN** `<skills-dir>/orbit-archive-change/references/archive-summary-schema.md` exists and
  documents the archive emit's fields (spine + `archive_path`, `audit`, `sync_specs`,
  `unresolved_markers`, `user_decision`, `warnings`), consistent with the baseline
  `Archive run summary written` requirement's field list

#### Scenario: Body cite resolves

- **WHEN** the archive skill body instructs reading `references/archive-summary-schema.md`
- **THEN** that path resolves within the generated skill directory (the B1-era dangling cite is
  closed)
