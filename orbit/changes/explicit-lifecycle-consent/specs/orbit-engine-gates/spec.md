## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Gate declaration in schema YAML

The schema YAML SHALL accept an optional `gates:` list. Each gate declares: `id` (unique among
gates and artifacts), `kind` (`tracked` | `reviewed` — a CLOSED set; any other value fails schema
validation), `requires` (artifact and/or gate ids that must be complete/passed before the gate is
runnable), and per-kind fields — `tracks` (checkbox file, `tracked` kind), `inputs` (freshness
scope: artifact ids whose change invalidates a pass; `reviewed` kind; defaults to `requires`),
`cadence` (ordered slot list, `reviewed` kind — see the cadence-entry vocabulary below), `confirm`
(the independent-confirmation predicate, `reviewed` kind: `no-new-findings` | `findings-resolved` —
a CLOSED set; selects which clause-(c) rule the gate uses; defaults to `no-new-findings`), `before`
(the target this gate blocks — see legal `before:` targets below), optional `consent` (see the
consent vocabulary below), and optional `instruction`.
There is NO generic pass-condition plugin mechanism — the two kinds are the extension surface.

**Cadence-entry vocabulary** (defined once here; referenced by clause (a) of the reviewed-gate
pass condition and by `spec-driven`): each `cadence` entry is one of the three reviewer classes
`in-context` | `fresh` | `external`, OR the meta-class `independent` (satisfied by a `fresh` OR an
`external` pass; never `in-context`). `independent` is a cadence-only token — it is NOT a value the
`reviewer_class` emit field ever carries.

**Legal `before:` targets**: a declared gate id, a declared artifact id, OR a lifecycle-phase token
from the enumerated set {`apply`, `archive`}. `apply` is modeled by the engine as a phase
(`orbit instructions apply` returns its gate state); `archive` is a lifecycle phase the CLI does
NOT model as an `instructions` target — a gate with `before: archive` is queried through the
archive workflow's gate surface (`orbit status --change <name> --json`, which carries `gates[]` and
`next_command`), never through `orbit instructions archive`.

**Consent vocabulary** (C-arc D1, per `orbit-lifecycle-consent`): `consent` is an optional gate
attribute with the single legal value `user-invoked` (a CLOSED set of one for v1; any other value
fails schema validation). It declares that entry into the gate's `before:` phase requires an
explicit user invocation — the engine PARSES and SURFACES the marker (in `gates[]` JSON and the
readouts per the single-voiced requirement below); the consuming workflow bodies implement the
consent prompt per `orbit-lifecycle-consent`'s provenance rule. The attribute changes NO gate
pass-condition computation — consent is orthogonal to gate state (a gate can be `passed` while
its phase still awaits the user's invocation). `spec-driven` sets `consent: user-invoked` on
`review-proposal` (before: apply) and `review-system` (before: archive).

#### Scenario: Valid gates list parses

- **WHEN** a schema YAML declares `gates:` entries with valid ids, kinds, and references
- **THEN** `parseSchema` accepts it; gate ids participate in the same duplicate/reference/cycle
  validation as artifact ids

#### Scenario: Unknown kind rejected

- **WHEN** a schema YAML declares a gate with `kind: scored` (or any value outside the closed set)
- **THEN** schema validation fails with an error naming the gate id and the allowed kinds

#### Scenario: Consent attribute parses, surfaces, and rejects unknown values

- **WHEN** a schema YAML declares `consent: user-invoked` on a gate
- **THEN** `parseSchema` accepts it and `orbit status --json` carries the marker on that gate's
  `gates[]` entry; a schema declaring any other consent value fails validation naming the gate id
  and the single legal value

#### Scenario: Consent does not alter gate computation

- **WHEN** a gate with `consent: user-invoked` meets its pass condition
- **THEN** its computed state is `passed` exactly as without the attribute — eligibility and
  consent are independent axes

### Requirement: Single-voiced canonical-next computation

The engine SHALL compute ONE canonical next command per change state — the full invocation with
all applicable arguments and flags (e.g. `/orbit:review-external --as system <change>`) — derived
from the gate graph and cadence position. When the next uncovered cadence slot is the `independent`
meta-class (satisfiable by a `fresh` OR an `external` pass), the engine's single canonical command
SHALL be the fresh-context review (`/orbit:review --as <mode> --fresh <change>`) — the lighter
proposal-phase default. An external pass also satisfies an `independent` slot for class-coverage
purposes, but the rendered recommendation stays single-voiced: the fresh-context command only, never
co-offered with the external alternative. Recommendation surfaces (gate reasons, blocked-by-gate
payloads, and the workflow handoffs that render them) SHALL present only this canonical command:
no advertised alternatives, no skip paths, and no bare command names without arguments. Skills
render the engine-computed command verbatim.

**Eligibility phrasing (C-arc D1, D-elc-4)**: the canonical-next command SHALL be rendered under
an eligibility-framed label — `Ready when you are:` — never an imperative label (`Next:` and
equivalents are prohibited on every recommendation surface: `orbit status` output,
`instructions` payload rendering, and generated workflow bodies that quote the readout). When the
canonical-next command's phase entry is consent-marked (`consent: user-invoked` on the gate whose
`before:` is that phase), the rendered line SHALL append the marker ` — user-invoked`
(e.g. `Ready when you are: /orbit:apply <name> — user-invoked`). Rationale: words are the API
when the consumer is a model; an imperative label reads as an instruction to execute. Emit FIELD
names (`next_recommended`) are unchanged — display wording only.

#### Scenario: One command, fully specified

- **WHEN** any recommendation surface renders the next step
- **THEN** it is a single complete invocation; phrasings like "run review-external next" (no
  arguments) or "or proceed directly to archive" (advertised skip) do not appear

#### Scenario: Eligibility label, never imperative

- **WHEN** `orbit status --change <name>` renders the canonical next command
- **THEN** the label is `Ready when you are:` (with ` — user-invoked` appended for
  consent-marked phase entries); no recommendation surface renders an imperative `Next:` label
